  <!-- 1. An adaptive website is still user friendly and covers some 
screen sizes, although it can't cover all sizes, as well
 as screens that come out in the future

2. mobile first - start from mobile layout and work your way up with min-width
   desktop first - start on desktop first, use max-width

3. it makes 1rem = 10px despite what browser youre in.

4. a more user friendly editor that scales much better than css, ie using variables/mixins to simplify the code.

5. nesting! Nothing really I love preprocessing. -->

            As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
            size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful
            you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so
            fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would
            fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

          <p>
            Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of
            the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of
            a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€”
            an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth,
            if free men make it.

              The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home
              that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely
              round.

              Suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the
              Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted
              out the planet Earth.
